        U-SAFE: Enterprise Safety Zone Management
    </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Secure Zones: Standard working areas suitable for all staff
        </li>
        <li>
            Risk Zones: Areas with potential hazards requiring special authorization
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Implementation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All employees receive company smartphones with pre-installed U-SAFE application
        </li>
        <li>
            The app continuously monitors employee locations and zone access
        </li>
        <li>
            Access permissions are managed through the system, with Risk Zones restricted to authorized personnel only
        </li>
        <li>
            Visual indicators (color-coded badges) on employee devices show current safety status
        </li>
    </ul>
