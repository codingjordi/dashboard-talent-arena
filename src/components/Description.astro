        U-SAFE: Enterprise Safety Zone Management
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text-xl underline">App Overview
    </h2>
    <p class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">U-SAFE enables enterprises to establish and manage controlled physical working zones within their facilities to monitor and prevent security incidents.</p>
    <p class="my-3 text-lg">These zones are classified into two categories:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc flex flex-col gap-2">
        <li>
            Secure Zones: Standard working areas suitable for all staff
        </li>
        <li>
            Risk Zones: Areas with potential hazards requiring special authorization
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl">User Implementation</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc flex flex-col gap-2 ml-0">
        <li>
            All employees receive company smartphones with pre-installed U-SAFE application
        </li>
        <li>
            The app continuously monitors employee locations and zone access
        </li>
        <li>
            Access permissions are managed through the system, with Risk Zones restricted to authorized personnel only
        </li>
        <li>
            Visual indicators (color-coded badges) on employee devices show current safety status
        </li>
    </ul>
